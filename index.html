                <h1>GPT's Random Text-Based Adventure Game üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h1>
                <p>Welcome to ChatGPT's text-based adventure game! After reading the bot's outcome scenario you will be
                    asked type your next action. <b>If GPT decides to restart or move back just repeat your message
                        until it properly continues the story.</b> Type 'end' at any time in the story to end it there.
                    <br><br>I followed a bit from this <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13xaumz/created_a_chooseyourown_adventure_game_free_form/"
                        target="_blank">text tutorial post</a> in order to properly learn how to type my prompt to make
                    a small, randomized text-based adventure game.
                    Theres also a prompt and description commented out in the code for a version where the bot gives you
                    4 choices too. The rationale behind choosing this tutorial is that I wanted to see how well chatbots
                    could play text-based adventure games (with the results of it even remembering a lot of what happens
                    in the story surprising me) and the tutorial itself being broad and easily editable. This
                    proof-of-concept shows how chatbots could potentially be used to generate outcomes in a story from
                    user decisions on the fly.
